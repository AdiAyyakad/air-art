# air-art

# Setup

To run, make sure you install `brew` by running `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

After that finishes, run `brew install swiftlint` and `brew install cocoapods`

After `cocoapods` finishes installing, go to the directory where this project is contained and run `pod install`.

After this you're all set! Just make sure to open up `AirArt.xcworkspace` and not `AirArt.xcodeproj`.
